On November 15th, 2022, between 9:00 and 11:00 AM Pacific Time, a web server experienced an outage that affected website performance for approximately 5% of users. The root cause of the issue was a configuration error that caused the server to overload and crash.

Timeline:

9:00 AM - The issue is detected when monitoring alerts are triggered.

9:05 AM - The issue is investigated by the engineering team. They identify the root cause as a configuration error.

9:10 AM - The team implements a fix and the issue is resolved.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the issue was a configuration error that caused the server to overload and crash. The issue was fixed by implementing a fix that corrected the configuration error.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent this issue from happening again, the engineering team will put in place a process to test server configurations before they are implemented.

Additionally, the team will create a monitoring alert to trigger if the server load exceeds a certain threshold.
